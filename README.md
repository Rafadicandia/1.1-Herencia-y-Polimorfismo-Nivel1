## 📄Description - Exercise Statement

### Exercise 1

In a music group, there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have `name` and `price` as attributes. Additionally, they have a method called `tocar()` (play). This method is abstract in the `Instrument` class and, therefore, must be implemented in the child classes. If a wind instrument is being played, the method should display on the console: "A wind instrument is playing", if a string instrument is being played: “A string instrument is playing” and if a percussion instrument is being played: “A percussion instrument is playing”.

The process of loading a class only happens once. Demonstrate that loading can be triggered by creating the first instance of that class or by accessing a static member of it.

Research information about initialization blocks and static blocks in Java.

### Exercise 2

Create a "Cotxe" (Car) class with the attributes: `marca` (brand), `model` (model), and `potencia` (power). The `marca` must be `static final`, the `model` `static`, and the `potencia` `final`. Demonstrate the difference between the three. Can any of them be initialized in the class constructor?

Add two methods to the "Cotxe" class. A static method called `frenar()` (brake) and another non-static method called `accelerar()` (accelerate). The `accelerar` method should display on the console: “The vehicle is accelerating” and the `frenar()` method should display: “The vehicle is braking”.

Demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the `main()` method of the main class.
